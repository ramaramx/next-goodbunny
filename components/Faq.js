        <h5>A: NFT as a technology is getting massive adoption, however many projects are mainly for capital gain, many is only pump dump projects, only some survive & continue to grow post-mint phase. NFT OG’s & investors want to find more quality projects that they believe are built to last with
strong teams, genuinely friendly community, executable clear roadmap, & have good utilities for holders. On the other hand, United Nation’s has 17 Sustainable Development Goals that we as the citizen of the world need to work together to achieve it. As the majority of the core team
members are either activists or donators, we have experienced & identified some roadblocks & pain points in doing social good that needs to be addressed, which are transparency, accountability & accessibility. 70% of donators are afraid whether the receiver will get the donation or not
due to poor donation documentation process. There are no clear end-to-end tracking available on the current web 2 social giving platforms. Also, 32% of donators don’t trust online platform credibility. Then lastly, 33% of donators are not aware that there are such thing as online social
giving platform & don’t know where to donate to support their social causes. This leads to our key critical insight which is a Blockchain technology revolution is happening, but there’s no leading ecosystem geared towards solving the transparency, accountability & accessibility
issues in driving social impact.
